## Dynamic Thrust Approximation

An attempt was made to approximate the dynamic thrust by analytical methods, which proved to be very inaccurate compared to experimental data in wind tunnels of similar propellers. Instead an experimental correction factor was used, as presented [by Gabriel Staples' blog](https://www.flitetest.com/articles/propeller-static-dynamic-thrust-calculation) with some sight modifications. Details on the method can be found in [thrust approx.pdf](thrust approx.pdf)
